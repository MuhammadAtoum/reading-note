# JavaScript

JavaScript can be used
in 
* browsers to make websites more interactive,interesting, and user-friendly.

## EXAMPLES OF JAVASCRIPT

# IN THE BROWSER
Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in
the browser is very powerful.
## The examples below rely on the ability to:

* Access the content of the page
* Modify the content of the page
* Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
* React to events triggered by the user or browser

# OPERATORS

*Expressions* rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
*create* a single value from one or more values.
*JavaScript* contains the mathematical operators, which you can use with numbers.


# WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

## Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).
