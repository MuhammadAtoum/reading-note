# CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear. For example, you can specify that
the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should
appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one
headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.

# CSS allows you to create rules that control the
way that each individual box (and the contents
of that box) is presented.

## Using CSS, you could add a
border around any of the boxes,
specify its width and height, or
add a background color. You
could also control text inside
a box â€” for example, its color,
size, and the typeface used.

# Example Styles

### Specific
