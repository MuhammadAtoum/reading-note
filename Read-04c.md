# Read-04c---Dynamic-web-pages-with-JavaScript

# we learned in javascript and jquery course.

## We came across the basics and fundamentals of javascript and jquery.
* Uses of javascript can be in many things such as form validation, events, etc.
* Uses of jquery can be in animation, DOM manipulation, etc.
* Javascript and jquery code can be implemented in inline as well as external scripts.
* Javascript programming basic concepts are variables, arrays,loops and conditionals.
* We created a project that contained a form that used javascript to validate things like required fields and email addresses.
* We used jquery to provide slide animation for our form

*The JavaScript* is added last and enhances the usability of the page or the experience of interacting with the site. Keeping it separate means that the page still works if the user cannot load or run the JavaScript. You can also reuse the code on several pages (making the site faster to load and easier to maintain). 

*JavaScript* is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script. This example adds a greeting into an HTML page. The greeting changes depending on the time of day.
