# operators; they allow programmers to
* create a single value from one or more values

* At the most basic level, you can
evaluate two variables using a
comparison operator to return a
t rue or f al se value.
* In this example, a user is taking a
test, and the script te lls the user
whether they have passed this
round of the test.

## Comparison and Logical operators are used to test for true or false

# Comparison Operators
* Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values

## How Can it be Used
Comparison operators can be used in conditional statements to compare values and take action depending on the result:

if (age < 18) text = "Too young to buy alcohol";

# Logical Operators
* Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

* Comparing Different Types
* Comparing data of different types may give unexpected results.

**When comparing a string with a number**, JavaScript will convert the string to a number when doing the comparison. An empty string converts to 0. A non-numeric string converts to NaN which is always false.

# The For Loop
* The for loop has the following syntax:

for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

# The While Loop
* The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

## Syntax of loop
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
# end
