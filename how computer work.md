# Ever wondered how the computer works? Here’s how.


## A computer is a machine (hardware) that receives and processes data according to the instructions given to it, and after the data has been processed, the results of the processing are usually sent to an output device.

### The input devices for feeding the computer with data and instructions can be a keyboard, mouse, scanner, or may be generated internally from ‘applications’ stored as programmed instructions (software). The processing of the data is done by the central processing unit (CPU), which is the heart of the computer. The output devices can be a screen (monitor), printer, plotter, speakers, ports, or another computer.

# How Computers Work: CPU, Memory, Input & Output

* Input: Your keyboard and mouse, for example, are just input units—ways of getting information into your computer that it can process. If you use a microphone and voice recognition software, that's another form of input.
* Memory/storage: Your computer probably stores all your documents and files on a hard drive: a huge magnetic memory. But smaller, computer-based devices like digital cameras and cellphones use other kinds of storage such as flash memory cards.
* Processing: Your computer's processor (sometimes known as the central processing unit) is a microchip buried deep inside. It works amazingly hard and gets incredibly hot in the process. That's why your computer has a little fan blowing away—to stop its brain from overheating!
* Output: Your computer probably has an LCD screen capable of displaying high-resolution (very detailed) graphics, and probably also stereo loudspeakers. You may have an inkjet printer on your desk too to make a more permanent form of output.
